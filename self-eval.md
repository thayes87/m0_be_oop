# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
*This was tough but actually got a little easier as the problems progressed. Similar to my struggles with the live pairing session, I found my initial thought process was limited by the overwhelming feeling of "what do I do?" but after I hacked my way through the first problem my mind opened and I had a better sense of what was being asked. I was operating under the assumption that all the skill we would need within this challenge would come from what we learned in the challenge and obviously this was incorrect.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
*this is actually one thing I am not struggling with EXCEPT when a CFU takes more than 2 hours in which I have to push my break back a little. I have become pretty good at identifying when I need a break and when my brain needs to walk away.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
*I need to be easy on myself. I got really frustrated when I couldn't solve the first issue to the point I didn't know how to start a method (DEF by the way). My frustration can really be a huge block when it comes to my thought process and I need to understand that I haven't been doing this for a week yet and it's OK if it is really hard. Excited to have time to work on problems like these with a more relaxed timeline.
